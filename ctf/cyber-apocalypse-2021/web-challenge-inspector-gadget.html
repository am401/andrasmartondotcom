            <h2>Challenge notes</h2>

            <p>Inspector Gadget was known for having a multitude of tools available for every occasion. Can you find them all?</p>
            
            <p>This challenge required a <b>Docker</b> container to be started which lead me to this page:</p>

            <img src="01_inspector_gadget_home_page.jpg">

            <p>The page is a fairly simple <b>HTML</b> page from what I can tell. Based on the challenge, it feels like we are trying to find clue's to the key, which has its start printed on the homepage as <b>CHTB{</b>. Looking at the source code, I immediately noticed this comment towards the bottom of the page:</p>

            <pre><code> &#60;!--1nsp3ction_--&#62;
&#60;/html&#62;</pre></code>

<p>I suspected the <b>1nsp3ction_</b> comment was part of the key and  was guiding me to the <b>Inspect</b> window, which I triggered by right clicking on the page and hitting <b>Inspect</b>. This pops open the development console window:</p>

            <p><b>us3full_Inf0rm4tion}</b> looks to be another clue, and the closed curly bracket makes me think this is the end of our key. The key still seemed to be missing something. I started to go through all the links to the files I found on the homepage to see if they would yield any further clues, after all, we were piecing the key together.</p>

            <p>During this review, within the <b>/static/js/main.js</b> file, I found the message to our console window that we found earlier:</p>

            <pre><code>/* c4n_r3ve4l_ */</code></pre>

            <p>Using the four different pieces I found, we can now build out our key: <b>CHTB{1nsp3ction_c4n_r3ve4l_us3full_Inf0rm4tion}</b>, suggesting that digging around and inspecting all the files lead us to the key.</p>
