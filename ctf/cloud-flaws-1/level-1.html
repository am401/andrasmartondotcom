            <h2>Challenge notes</h2>
            <p>This level is *buckets* of fun. See if you can find the first sub-domain.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>For this challenge, we are asked to find the next level's sub-domain. The clue we get is it will be related to Amazon S3 buckets. Looking at <a href="http://flaws.cloud">flaws.cloud</a>'s DNS records we can see that the domain is pointed at an IP address (<b>52.218.220.162</b>):</p>
            <pre><code>dig A +noall flaws.cloud +answer
flaws.cloud.		5	IN	A	52.218.220.18</code></pre>
            <p>Checking for CNAME records did not reveal anything interesting, but the IP address appears to belong to an S3 bucket. Trying to directly visit this IP address in the browser redirects us to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> site.</p>
            <p>Based on the hint about buckets, we we can start exploring the idea that the site may be hosted as a static site within an AWS Bucket. If this is the case, reviewing the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html#root-domain-walkthrough-create-buckets">Configuring a static website using a custom domain</a> documentation comes to hand. <b>Step 2</b> indicates the following: <b>These bucket names must match your domain name exactly</b>.</p>
            <p>Searching around for the domain structure of static sites hosted on AWS S3 buckets, I found <a href="https://www.cdputnam.com/blog/s3-custom-domain/">this article on hosting a site on an S3 bucket</a> which lead me to thefollowing syntax:</p>
            <pre><code>AWS auto-populated: example.com.s3.amazonaws.com
Direct, Region spcific S3 URL to use: example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code></pre>
            <p>We already know that when hosting a static site, the bucket name will need to match the custom domain. Using the above formula, therefore we can try out the domain <a href="http://flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com">flaws.cloud.s3.amazonaws.com</a>. In my experience, Amazon bucket information is displayed as an XML file. Going to the above site, that is exactly that we end up with. Scrolling down, we find the following:</p>
            <pre><code>This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below. 
&#60;ListBucketResult&#62;
&#60;Name&#62;flaws.cloud&#60;/Name&#62;
&#60;Prefix/&#62;
&#60;Marker/&#62;
&#60;MaxKeys&#62;1000&#60;/MaxKeys&#62;
&#60;IsTruncated&#62;false&#60;/IsTruncated&#62;
...

...
&#60;Contents&#62;
&#60;Key&#62;secret-dd02c7c.html&#60;/Key&#62;
&#60;LastModified&#62;2017-02-27T01:59:30.000Z&#60;/LastModified&#62;
&#60;ETag&#62;"c5e83d744b4736664ac8375d4464ed4c"&#60;/ETag&#62;
&#60;Size&#62;1051&#60;/Size&#62;
&#60;StorageClass&#62;STANDARD&#60;/StorageClass&#62;
&#60;/Contents&#62;
&#60;/ListBucketResult&#62;</code></pre>
            <p>Towards the bottom, we can see a file called <b>secret-dd02c7c.html</b>. When we visit the page we are greeted with the following message:</p>
            <pre><code>_____  _       ____  __    __  _____
|     || |     /    ||  |__|  |/ ___/
|   __|| |    |  o  ||  |  |  (   \_
|  |_  | |___ |     ||  |  |  |\__  |
|   _] |     ||  _  ||  `  '  |/  \ |
|  |   |     ||  |  | \      / \    |
|__|   |_____||__|__|  \_/\_/   \___|

Congrats! You found the secret file!
