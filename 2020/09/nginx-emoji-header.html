			<h1>add emojis to nginx HTTP headers</h1>
			<h2>Written: 2020/04/29</h2>
            <p>The other day while perusing Twitter, I came across a Tweet mentioning <a href="https://icanhazip.com">icanhazip.com</a>, a site I regularly use to confirm either my <strong>IPv4</strong> or <strong>IPv6</strong> public IP address.</p>

            <p>The site is run by <a href="https://twitter.com/majorhayden">Major Hayden</a> who I also happen to follow on Twitter. The combination of the two yielded me coming across the <a href="https://twitter.com/elenalindq/status/1304651703904546816" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/elenalindq/status/1304651703904546816">following tweet by @elenalindq</a> in my feed about a Duck emoji in the header of the site:</p>

            <pre><code>curl -IL https://icanhazip.com

            <p>That lead me to locate other Tweets and posts about using emoji&#8217;s in NGINX headers, or HTTP headers as a whole. Some further digging is showing that as long as the UTC-8 character set is enabled on the server, the use of emoji&#8217;s within the NGINX configuration file should work.</p>

            <p>I went on to test various emoji setups out by setting various headers within www.placeonthe.net&#8217;s configuration file. While trying out different emoji&#8217;s, I did note that using the actual unicode for the emoji did not render correctly.</p>

            <p>I eventually found an NGINX article covering the use of emoji&#8217;s within the NGINX configuration file at <a href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/emoji-nginx-plus-configuration/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nginx.com/blog/emoji-nginx-plus-configuration/">Introducing Full Emoji Support in NGINX and NGINX Plus Configuration</a>. The article indicated just copying the emoji in to the configuration file will allow it to be used in even more ways than just returning a header.</p>

            <p>I eventually found a <a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html#1f369" data-type="URL" data-id="https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html#1f369">good list of emoji&#8217;s</a> to test within the configuration file and how they would look when being viewed via cURL in this case.. I eventually settled on the glorious donut: üç© </p>

            <p>So far I have tested this on Ubuntu, OSX and OpenBSD using iTerm2 without issues and using Chrome&#8217;s Dev Tools to view headers too. I was able to open the NGINX configuration file using vim and the emoji was present. Parsing the configuration file also did not return any errors!</p>

            <p>In order to set the actual header in the configuration file I merely applied the following header: </p>

            <pre><code>add_header X-Donut: "üç©";</code></pre>

            <p>I have found a few interesting examples online of using the headers more as comical representations than for anything beyond that, but it&#8217;s certainly a quirky feature. Definitely an interesting concept I will continue to explore.</p>
