			<h1>add emojis to nginx HTTP headers</h1>
			<h2>Written: 2020/04/29</h2>
			<p>The idea to explore adding emojis into response headers came after reading the following <a href="https://twitter.com/elenalindq/status/1304651703904546816">Tweet by @elenalindq</a>, specifically mentioning <a href="https://icanhazip.com">icanhazip.com</a>, which at the time of writing has a duck emoji HTTP response header as ween below:</p>
            <pre><code>curl -IL https://icanhazip.com
HTTP/2 200
server: nginx
date: Tue, 15 Sep 2020 03:32:56 GMT
content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
content-length: 13

            <p>That lead me to locate other Tweets and posts about using emoji&#8217;s in NGINX headers, or HTTP headers as a whole. After some addtional digging I found that as long as the UTC-8 character set is enabled on the server, the use of emoji&#8217;s within the NGINX configuration file should work.</p>
            <p>I eventually found an NGINX article covering the use of emoji&#8217;s within the NGINX configuration file at <a href="https://www.nginx.com/blog/emoji-nginx-plus-configuration/">Introducing Full Emoji Support in NGINX and NGINX Plus Configuration</a>. The article indicated copying the emoji in to the configuration file will allow it to be used in even more ways than just returning a header, such as adding them as comments within the NGINX configuration file.</p>
            <p>I eventually found a <a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html#1f369">good list of emoji&#8217;s</a> to test within the configuration file and how they would look when being viewed via cURL in this case.</p>
            <pre><code>curl -IL https://example.com
HTTP/2 200
date: Tue, 15 Sep 2020 03:49:38 GMT
content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
vary: Accept-Encoding

            <p>So far I have tested this on Ubuntu, OSX and OpenBSD using iTerm2 without issues and using Chrome&#8217;s Dev Tools to view headers too. I was able to open the NGINX configuration file using vim and the emoji was present. Parsing the configuration file also did not return any errors!</p>
            <p>In order to set the actual header in the configuration file the following header can be used, just change the header name and the emoji to suit your needs: </p>
            <pre><code>add_header X-Donut: "üç©";</code></pre>
            <p>The headers are more practical in terms of providing a quirk feature as opposed to a practical functionality. Definitely an interesting concept I will continue to explore.</p>
